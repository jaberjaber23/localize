# Localize

Localize is an innovative project developed by Jaber Jaber and Zaid Rjoub for the Artificial Intelligence Hackathon. Our project aims to address the global problem of language barriers in education by leveraging advanced AI technology. We have developed a powerful AI stack that combines two AI models to facilitate dubbing and enhance accessibility to educational content worldwide.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

It is estimated that 40% of the world’s population does not have access to education in a language they speak or understand. With approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, linguistic diversity is increasingly threatened as languages disappear at an alarming rate. When a language disappears, it takes with it an entire cultural and intellectual heritage.

## 💡 Solution

Localize provides a solution to this pressing issue by leveraging AI technology to bridge language gaps in education. Our AI stack consists of two core components:

1. **Dubbing Model**: An advanced AI model capable of seamlessly extracting subtitles from videos and creating perfectly synchronized dubbed versions. This groundbreaking technology ensures that educational content is accessible to individuals regardless of their native language.

2. **Educational Chatbot**: A custom chatbot powered by a fine-tuned Language Model (LLM) that comprehends and responds to questions derived from video content. This chatbot enhances the learning experience by providing detailed and informative answers, catering to learners' needs in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- Seamless dubbing of educational videos to make them accessible in multiple languages.
- Interactive educational chatbot that responds to questions based on video content.
- Accessibility to educational materials in both Arabic and English, without the need for extensive language learning.
- Celebration and preservation of linguistic diversity and cultural heritage.
